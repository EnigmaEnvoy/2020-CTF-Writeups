# Shared Dreaming (Crypto)  
  
  
> It's not just about depth you know, you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturally in a subject's mind; it's a very subtle art.  
> A [text file](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/2020-CTF-Writeups/blob/master/B01lers%20CTF/Shared%20Dreaming/shareddreaming-0d9787a4fb3e48d2b6a8c7cb1a7db618.txt) having some hints was also given.  
  
  
Using all the hints provided in the text file and XOR functions, the flag was obtained using [this python code](https://github.com/EnigmaEnvoy/2020-CTF-Writeups/blob/master/B01lers%20CTF/Shared%20Dreaming/shareddreaming.py). All the explanations are written as comments in the code.
